## **In the Pixelated Playground**

Hey everyone! I'm Camilo Hernandez, a tech enthusiast hailing from the lively city of Cali, Colombia. Buckle up for a trip down memory lane as I share my captivating journey from a console-loving kid to a software maestro.

### **Level 1: Console Chronicles**

Picture this â€” it's Christmas, and my father gifts me a PlayStation 2. Cue the excitement of waking up early to dive into virtual adventures, either solo or with my pals. Little did I know, this was the spark that ignited my passion for the digital realm.

### **Level 2: The Gateway - My First Computer**

Two years later, my dad ups the ante with my very own computer, opening the door to an uncharted world. Curiosity becomes my guiding light as I explore the vast possibilities behind the screen.

## **Coding Quest Begins**

And thus, the saga of self-discovery in the programming universe kicks off. Let's break it down.

### **Chapter 1: Scratch and the Canvas**

Enter Scratch, a magical program for creating online games through user-friendly algorithms. At sweet 16, I'm already dabbling in CSS and HTML, laying the foundation for my high school project. The journey begins to transform pixels into interactive masterpieces.

### **Chapter 2: USA Expedition - English, Algorithms, and Unexpected Citizenship**

Fast forward to 17; I embark on a year and a half in the United States. Beyond refining my English at the Community College of Philadelphia, the experience broadens my horizons culturally and technologically. An unexpected twist? Gaining US citizenship through my father's legacy.

### **Chapter 3: University Adventures - Algorithms, Logic, and Languages**

Back in Colombia at 18 due to economic constraints, I enroll in the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Occidente to pursue web and mobile application design and development. Over three years, I delve into the intricacies of algorithmics, computational logic, and programming languages like Java, PHP, and SQL.

## **Professional Power-Ups**

### **Play Technologies - A Training Ground**

At 20, the professional realm beckons at Play Technologies. Eleven months of diverse experiences, from infrastructure nuances to crafting applications in React Native, Angular, and NodeJs. The introduction to Scrum becomes a key feature in my growing skill set.

### **Branger Briz - Conquering Global Challenges**

Fast forward again; my current journey at Branger Briz unfolds over two enriching years. Collaborating with industry giants like Adidas, Paramount, and Nike becomes my norm. VueJs, ReactJs, NextJs, Express, NestJS - I navigate through these frameworks seamlessly. Embracing micro-services architecture, AWS infrastructure becomes a playground with tools like Cognito, Lambda, SQS, API Gateway, and S3. Agile methodologies like Kanban and Scrum guide my team collaborations.

## **The Grand Finale - University, Dreams, and Beyond**

As I wrap up my university degree at the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Occidente, the journey is far from over. The hunger for learning still burns bright, and the dream is to venture where the mind dreams and capabilities materialize.

Thanks for joining me on this thrilling ride through the bits and bytes of my life. Until the next level! ðŸš€
